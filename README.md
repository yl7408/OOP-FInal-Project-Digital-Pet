# OOP-FInal-Project-Digital-Pet
Digital Pet Simulation
In this program, we will create a digital pet of chosen gender and use button options to feed and/or pet them. Also, a happiness meter will appear for the "pet" of the program. If a certain time period in minutes after program starts has passed without it getting fed or pet, the happiness meter will go down from 100. Once it reaches zeroes, the pet will disappear from the storage array and a new pet has to be created.
